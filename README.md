# Meet the instructor

## Professor Barry
Professor Patrick Barry is a clinical assistant professor and the director of digital academic initiatives at the University of Michigan Law School. His teaching and research focus on creating a new vocabulary to talk about advocacy.

## Teaching Style
My approach to teaching focuses on three things:

- Creating an engaging conceptual vocabulary people can use and share.
- Providing plenty of opportunities for low-stakes practice.
- Helping people apply what they've learned to high-stakes projects.

With these goals in mind, I want to offer some tips on how to get the most of this course.
